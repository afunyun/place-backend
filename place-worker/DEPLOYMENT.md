# Place Worker Deployment Guide

## ✅ Conversion Status: COMPLETE

### Successfully Migrated Components
- ✅ HTTP Routes (`/grid`, `/pixel`) 
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates (`/ws`)
- ✅ Grid state management (Durable Objects)
- ✅ CORS handling
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Data migration (1045 existing pixels)

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Local Testing Complete ✅
- [x] GET /grid endpoint returns 500x500 grid
- [x] POST /pixel updates work with validation  
- [x] WebSocket connections established successfully
- [x] Real-time pixel broadcasts functional
- [x] Existing grid data migrated (1045 pixels)

### 2. Production Configuration
- [x] wrangler.jsonc configured with Durable Objects
- [x] GridDurableObject class exported
- [x] Migrations configured for v1

### 3. Performance Optimizations ✅
- [x] Optimized storage (individual pixels vs full grid)
- [x] Efficient grid loading from Durable Objects
- [x] WebSocket session management
- [x] Error handling and cleanup

## Deployment Commands

### Set Up Discord Webhook Secret
```bash
cd place-worker
# Set the Discord webhook URL as a secret (more secure than environment variables)
wrangler secret put DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
# When prompted, paste: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1388700167170953377/ovEsmIGQyGRU2Cu3mEAT4RtdkWYpOM-OKic_lzVFZmP0W1ofvIAJtpxkGYiu7zGFr83a
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
cd place-worker
wrangler deploy --minify
```

### Deploy to Staging (if needed)
```bash
wrangler deploy --minify --env staging
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Test Production Endpoints
Replace `YOUR_WORKER_URL` with the deployed URL:

```bash
# Test grid endpoint  
curl https://YOUR_WORKER_URL.workers.dev/grid | jq 'length'

# Test pixel update
curl -X POST https://YOUR_WORKER_URL.workers.dev/pixel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"x": 100, "y": 100, "color": "#FF0000"}'

# Verify update
curl https://YOUR_WORKER_URL.workers.dev/grid | jq '.[100][100]'
```

### 2. Test WebSocket Connection
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://YOUR_WORKER_URL.workers.dev/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));
```

## Architecture Overview

### Before (Express.js)
- Express server on single host
- Socket.IO for WebSockets  
- File-based persistence (grid_data.json)
- In-memory state management

### After (Cloudflare Workers)
- Global edge distribution
- Native WebSocket API
- Durable Objects for persistence  
- Per-pixel storage optimization

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Global Performance**: Deployed to 300+ locations worldwide
2. **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically  
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-request pricing model
4. **Built-in DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare's security layer
5. **Zero Server Management**: Fully serverless architecture

## Migration Notes

- **Storage Method**: Changed from full grid storage to per-pixel storage
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Migrated from Socket.IO to native WebSocket API
- **State Persistence**: File system → Durable Objects
- **CORS Handling**: Now handled at Worker level

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback steps:
1. Update DNS to point back to original Express server
2. Ensure original server has latest grid_data.json
3. Monitor for any data inconsistencies

## Cost Monitoring

- Monitor Durable Objects usage in Cloudflare Dashboard
- Watch for request volume increases
- Set up billing alerts for unexpected costs

## Support & Troubleshooting  

- Check Cloudflare Workers logs in dashboard
- Durable Objects are region-persistent  
- WebSocket connections have automatic cleanup
- All test scripts available in this directory
